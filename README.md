# About
This is a running sample application for my Medium article about object detection and tracking with Android and Firebase ML Kit.
The app builds upon a small library which I published (https://github.com/crysxd/CameraX-Object-Tracking) and only includes a bare configuration of the library and the Firebase ML Kit implementation to detect fashion goods (test it with shoes!).

# Bring this app to live
This app works but requires a Firebase project to compile. I do not include my project cpnfiguration in the sources.
In order to compile this, you need to:

- Create a Firebase project
- Add an app in the Firebase console
- Download the google-service.json and past it into the app folder
